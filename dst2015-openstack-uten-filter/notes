UH IaaS focus points “wishlist” below:

“How possible is OpenStack?”

   #1 You don’t buy OpenStack, you learn it
   #2 If you think you could buy it, then you’d be WAY BETTER OFF just
   using public cloud


OpenStack
Operativsystem
Lagring
Nettverk

   Our own history

      6 senior FTEs for a year, 2 of them already invested in OpenStack and
      automation

      Anything less will most likely not be enough!

      But it depends on context and where your goal posts are

         sum up some easy wins with “Openstack as an appliance”
      that ^^ is not really cloud, is not really IaaS


The hardest tech problem? The network.

“An OpenStack networking solution that really works”

   -

   Cumulus Linux+Dell hardware
   -

   Project Calico, scalable L3 routed fabric
   -

      No NAT, because we can do IPv6
      -

      No NAT, because we can use IP-based security policies
      -

      No VLANS  because of the above


Are you done? When are you done? We will never be done, actually 

“What are we looking at as our next steps?”

   -

   Gain more operational knowledge and document processes in the base IaaS
   systems
   -

      We’re not going to be AWS or Rackspace but we’ll need to continously
      improve and gain more of our users trust
      -

   Create and maintain feedback loops neccessary to develop and extend HPC
   usage
   -

   More flexible authentication/authorization to enable more seamless
   collabration - this is a project on top on FEIDE from UNINETT called
   Connect www.feideconnect.no
   -

   Openshift (kubernetes+docker) as a paas on our platform
